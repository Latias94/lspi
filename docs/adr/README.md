# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We use ADRs to record **important architectural decisions** with their context and consequences.

## Format

We follow a lightweight MADR-style structure:

- Title
- Status (Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded)
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences

## Conventions

- Files are numbered: `0001-...md`, `0002-...md`, ...
- Keep decisions small and focused.
- If a decision changes, write a new ADR and mark the old one as Superseded.
